📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes a simulated CRM (Customer Relationship Management) dataset to uncover insights into sales team performance, agent effectiveness, quarterly sales trends, and product win rates.

The goal is to demonstrate data analysis skills by working through real-world business questions using structured datasets related to sales operations.



🗂️ Datasets

The project is based on four core datasets:

Dataset	Description
accounts.csv	Contains information about client accounts.
products.csv	List of products being sold, including categories and pricing.
sales_pipeline.csv	Tracks individual sales opportunities, their status, value, and related sales agent.
sales_teams.csv	Details of sales teams and the agents assigned to them.
